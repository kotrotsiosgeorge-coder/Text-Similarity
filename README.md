# Final Exam Project – Programming, Linear Algebra & NLP

This project integrates **Python engineering**, **information theory**, and **Natural Language Processing** to solve three independent yet conceptually connected computational challenges:
1️⃣ A custom NumPy-style mini-library  
2️⃣ Hamming code encoding & decoding system  
3️⃣ Advanced text similarity ranking engine  

The project demonstrates algorithmic thinking, mathematical modeling, performance awareness, and practical software design.

## 🧠 Part 1 — Sub-NumPy Library
A lightweight NumPy-inspired implementation that reconstructs essential numerical computing behaviors without relying on NumPy.
### ✨ Capabilities
- Vector & matrix manipulation
- Basic linear algebra operations
- Arithmetic operations
- Internal consistency & validation logic

📌 Purpose: demonstrate understanding of vectorization concepts, array structures, performance trade-offs, and computational reasoning.

---

## 🔐 Part 2 — Hamming Code (Error Detection & Correction)
Implements **Hamming (7,4)–style error correcting code** used in communication, networking, and storage systems.

### ✨ Features
- Binary encoding
- Parity bit generation
- Error detection
- Single-bit error correction
- Decoding back to original message

📌 Purpose: apply information theory in practice and show understanding of reliability in digital systems.

---

## 📝 Part 3 — Text Similarity Ranking (NLP)
Compares and ranks similarity between a *query text* and multiple candidate texts using statistical and vector-space NLP models.

### ✨ Techniques Implemented
- Damerau–Levenshtein distance  
- TF-IDF vectorization  
- Dot-product similarity  
- Euclidean distance comparison  

The system outputs ranked similarity scores and analyzes linguistic behavior across different text categories (including poems and controlled equal-length texts).

📌 Purpose: demonstrate analytical NLP capability and evaluate real-world text similarity methods.
